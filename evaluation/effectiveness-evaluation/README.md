# Effectiveness Evaluation
This folder contains the results, the raw data and scripts to extract the data from the sources for our effectiveness evaluation.

## Objective
The goal of the effectiveness analysis is to validate the usability and relevance of the RetroWoT method under different conditions.
We created two datasets G1 and G2 for our effectiveness analysis. 
G1 uses data from standardization organizations that provide Product Listing Databases for qualified ZigBee and Bluetooth devices.
G2 uses data from a less controlled environment, so providing more insights about the actual usage of devices.



## G1 Datasets
### Methodology
The specific methodology with the scripts can be found [here for Bluetooth](./bluetooth-scraper/bluetooth-scrapper/README.md) and [here for ZigBee](./zigbee-scraper/zigbee-scrapper/README.md). 
### Analysis of the Results
