# Service Capability Ontology
This is the Service Capability (SCO). SCO is a light-weight, application ontology for the translation of legacy IoT devices to the W3C Web of Things.
SCO contributes to the automatic generation of Thing Descriptions for modeling the key components necessary for a W3C Web of Things Thing Description.

## Ontology Requirement Specification
The aim of the requirements specification process is to state why the ontology is being built and to identify and define the requirements the ontology should fulfil.

### Use Case Specification
Activity aiming to provide a vision of potential use of ontology.
* Artefact: List of Usecases
* Result: [Use Cases](./doc/usecases/use-case-specification.md)

### Data Exchange Identification / Knowledge Acquisition
Activity aiming to provide the the necessary documentation about the domain to be modeled (e.g., data sets, regulations, standards, data formats, API identification, database schema, etc.)
* Artefact: Set of domain documents and resources
* Results: [Domain Documents and Resources](./doc/knowledge-acquisition//document-overview.md)

### Purpose, Scope & Requirements Identification
Activity aiming to descre the purpose and scope of the ontology; and to produce a set of functional & non- functional requirements that can be materialized into Competency Questions (CQs), Natural Language Statement or Tabular Information
* Artefacts: Text describing purpose & scope, Set of requirements, Tabular information about concepts, relations & attributes
* Results: [Domain Requirement Table](./doc/ontology-requirements-specification-document/domain-requirement-table.xlsx)


### Functional Ontology Requirements Formalization
Activity aiming to formalize requirements into test cases.
* Artefacts: set of test cases including  requirement identifier, test case description, corresponding SPARQL query, and query's expected result. 
* Results: [Test Cases](./testcases.md)

### Ontology Requirements specification document (ORSD) formalization
The ORSD stores all functional and non-functional requirements identified and the information associated with them 
* Result: [Ontology Requirment Specifcation Document](./doc/ontology-requirements-specification-document/ontology-requirement-specification-document.md)
