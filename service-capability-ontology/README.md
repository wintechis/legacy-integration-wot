# Goal
The aim of the requirements specification process is to state why the ontology is being built and to identify and define the requirements the ontology should fulfil.

### Use Case Specification
Activity aiming to provide a vision of potential use of ontology.
* Artefact: List of Usecases
* Result: [Use Cases](./use-case-specification.md)

### Data Exchange Identification / Knowledge Acquisition
Activity aiming to provide the the necessary documentation about the domain to be modeled (e.g., data sets, regulations, standards, data formats, API identification, database schema, etc.)
* Artefact: Set of domain documents and resources
* Results: [Domain Documents and Resources](./documents/document-overview.md)

### Purpose, Scope & Requirements Identification
Activity aiming to descre the purpose and scope of the ontology; and to produce a set of functional & non- functional requirements that can be materialized into Competency Questions (CQs), Natural Language Statement or Tabular Information
* Artefacts: Text describing purpose & scope, Set of requirements, Tabular information about concepts, relations & attributes
* Results: [Domain Requirement Table](./domain-requirement-table.xlsx)


### Functional Ontology Requirements Formalization
Activity aiming to formalize requirements into test cases.
* Artefacts: set of test cases including  requirement identifier, test case description, corresponding SPARQL query, and query's expected result. 
* Results: [Test Cases](./testcases.md)

### Ontology Requirements specification document (ORSD) formalization
The ORSD stores all functional and non-functional requirements identified and the information associated with them 
* Result: [Ontology Requirment Specifcation Document](./ontology-requirement-specification-document.md)
